#### From Environment Variables to Browser Storage:
- **Old**: `.env` files with API keys loaded via webpack
- **New**: Browser localStorage with API keys entered via UI

#### From Single AI Provider to Multi-Provider:
- **Old**: OpenAI only with environment configuration
- **New**: OpenAI, Gemini, and Claude with browser-based API key management

### 📋 Key Benefits

1. **Accurate Documentation**: All docs now reflect the actual React-based codebase
2. **Simplified Setup**: No environment variable configuration needed
3. **Better User Experience**: API keys managed through intuitive UI
4. **Reduced Maintenance**: Removed duplicate and outdated documentation
5. **Modern Architecture**: Documentation shows current React/TypeScript patterns

### 🎯 Current State

The documentation now accurately represents:
- ✅ React-based UI with component architecture
- ✅ Browser-based API key management (no environment variables)
- ✅ Multi-provider AI support (OpenAI/Gemini/Claude)
- ✅ Mobile-responsive design with React patterns
- ✅ Modern development workflow with webpack and GitHub Pages deployment

All unnecessary documentation files have been removed, and existing files have been updated to reflect the current React-based architecture.
